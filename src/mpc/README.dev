Source code from the subversion repository
------------------------------------------

To compile source code obtained from the subversion repository,
make sure you have installed the autoconf, automake and libtool packages.
Execute
$ autoreconf -i

Required versions:
* autoconf >= 2.61
* automake >= 1.11.6
* libtool >= 2.4.3

Creating a new release
----------------------

 1) Check compilation with latest gmp and mpfr, with gmp 4.3.2 and mpfr 2.4.2;
    with and without "--enable-valgrind-tests --disable-shared".
 2) Check the version number in configure.ac ("AC_INIT (mpc, _version_...)"),
    INSTALL, src/get_version.c, src/mpc.h (remove suffix "dev" in
    MPC_VERSION_STRING) and Makefile.vc.
 3) Verify that the ABI version in src/Makefile.am is correct.
 4) Check that NEWS, BUGS and TODO are up to date, and that the minimal
    version numbers of gmp and mpfr in configure.ac, INSTALL and
    doc/mpc.texi are correct.
 5) Execute "autoreconf; touch doc/mpc.texi; make distcheck".
    This updates the date and version number in doc/version.texi and
    creates the tarball for distribution.
 6) Create an svn tag from inside the svn root:
    svn cp trunk tags/VERSION
 7) Update the web page on the server.
    The html documentation is created with
       makeinfo --html --no-split mpc.texi
    and the resulting mpc.html is copied to content_html.php.
 8) After the release, update the version number in configure.ac, INSTALL,
    src/get_version.c, src/mpc.h and Makefile.vc.
 9) Potentially increase the API version in src/Makefile.am.
10) Commit the changes to svn.
