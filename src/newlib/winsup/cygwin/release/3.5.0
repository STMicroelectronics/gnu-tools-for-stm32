What's new:
-----------

- Drop support for Windows 7, Windows 8, Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012.

- The console device gets accessible from other terminals such as other
  consoles and ptys. Thanks to this new feature, GNU screen and tmux
  now work in the console.

- newgrp(1) tool.

- cygcheck has new options searching for available packages in the
  cygwin distro, as well as getting extended info on available and
  installed packages.

- fnmatch(3) and glob(3) now support named character classes, equivalence
  class expressions, and collating symbols in the search pattern, i.e.,
  [:alnum:], [=a=], [.aa.].

- Introduce /proc/codesets and /proc/locales with information on
  supported codesets and locales for all interested parties.  Locale(1)
  opens these files and uses the info for printing locale info like any
  other process could do.

- Add support for GB18030 codeset.

- New API calls: posix_spawn_file_actions_addchdir_np,
  posix_spawn_file_actions_addfchdir_np.

What changed:
-------------

- posix_spawnp no longer falls back to starting the shell for unrecognized
  files as execvp.  For the reasoning, see
