These scripts and helper applications are used to create locale data
required for complete locale support, but either missing in Windows
or implemented in a non-POSIXy way.

The script has to run from inside a glibc git clone.
The C tools can be built without any special options.

All three tools generate the new locale headers (lc_collelem.h,
lc_era.h, lc_msg.h) in the current working directory.  They can just
be copied to local_includes and commited without further changes.
